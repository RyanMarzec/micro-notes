# micro-notes
web based note taking app

TODO:

Better cancel button:
  - Currently just refreshing page without saving new content to notes.
  - I am sure there is a better, more dynamic way of doing this that I am unaware of at this time
  
Contain longer notes within the provided div section:
  - Currently when notes become long enough they will start to trail outside of the provided space.
  - This happens because the div is a fixed size
  - make div scrollable?
